## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Open
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd githubCleaner
```

### 2. Create GitHub Personal Access Token

For security reasons, this application uses GitHub Personal Access Tokens instead of OAuth:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name like "Repository Cleaner"
4. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `delete_repo` (Delete repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

### 3. Run the Application

Since this is a client-side application, you need to serve it through a web server:

#### Option A: Using Python (if installed)
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 5500

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500
```

#### Option B: Using Node.js (if installed)
```bash
npx http-server -p 5500
```

#### Option C: Using Live Server (VS Code extension)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5500
```
(or whatever port you're using)

### 5. Sign In

1. Click "Sign In to GitHub"
2. Paste your Personal Access Token when prompted
3. The app will load your repositories

## Usage

- Use "Select All" to select all visible repositories
- Use "Deselect All" to clear all selections
- Selected count is displayed in the bottom right

2. Click "Delete Selected" (only enabled when repositories are selected)
3. Review the list in the confirmation dialog

## Security Notes

- Personal Access Tokens are stored in browser localStorage
- Tokens are sent securely to GitHub API over HTTPS
- No server-side storage or logging of credentials
- Always use minimal required scopes for tokens

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Chrome 51+
- Firefox 54+
- Safari 10+
- Edge 15+

## API Rate Limits

GitHub API has rate limits:
- 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated requests
- The app loads repositories in batches to minimize API calls
- Delete operations are throttled to respect rate limits

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load repositories"
- Check that your Personal Access Token is valid
- Ensure the token has `repo` scope
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "Failed to delete repository"
- Ensure your token has `delete_repo` scope
- Some repositories may have protection rules
- Organization repositories may require additional permissions

### Authentication Issues
- Clear browser localStorage and try again
- Generate a new Personal Access Token
- Check that you're using a "classic" token, not fine-grained

## Development

The application is built with:
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** - No frameworks or dependencies
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with flexbox and grid
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **GitHub REST API v3** - Repository management

### Key Classes
